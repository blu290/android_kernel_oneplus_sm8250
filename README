Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.


yeah yeah whatever you've seen this before. idk how to write a readme but like

this kernel is mostly stock, patched with kernelsu and susfs.
if you don't know what those are, you're probs in the wrong place...

most things work from my limited testing (daily use) but fast charging is broken

i wish i knew why

to build you can just run build.sh, make sure you have all the requirements which idr

don't expect any support or anything, I made these modifications for personal use and
i thought that someone could benefit from these being made public. i'll probs do a release
when i have time to figure out how anykernel3 works but for now i'm a busy bee
