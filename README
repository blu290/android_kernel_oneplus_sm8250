Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

***yeah yeah whatever you've seen this before. idk how to write a readme but like***
# The kernel
* this kernel is mostly unmodified but patched with kernelsu and susfs. If you are unaware of what these are then you are definitely someone who won't benefit from this.

# Features
* LineageOS kernel
* KernelSU integrated via patching source rather than kprobes
* SUSFS for KSU
* that's it, it's mostly unmodified

# Known issues
* fast charging is broken, I wish I knew why.
* everything else works based on my daily use. I haven't extensively tested beyond that.

# Build
* for now there is no public release because I can't be bothered to use anykernel3, i simply just repack my boot.img with the new kernel
* to build you can just run build.sh, make sure you have all the requirements which idr.

# Why you should use this:
* **You Shouldn't!** no but seriously, this is just something that I use personally, and I see a lot of people who are unable to apply these patches to their own kernel so I decided to publish my work. You're free to use it but expect absolutely no support, if you have issues you're free to report or fix them. I probs won't get to them because I'm a very busy bee and I don't have *that* much time to figure out what's wrong.
